- 👋 Hell there... I’m Tracy

👀 I am graduating this fall with an MBA in Business Analytics and a certificate in Big Data Analytics. Woohoo!!  AND I’m interested in pivoting into the business analytics field.

📫🏝 Caribbean born, NY 🍎grown, with a passion for working with different groups of people, deep diving into data 🤓(making it make sense to others 😀) and creating programs and messaging. I love finding solutions to problems and creating strategic plans. 

🏫I spent the last 15 years working in higher education developing programs to increase success targets, program completion and retention rates. I create partnerships with outside stakeholders and senior university/college administrators to exceed KPIs. 

💞️I am a visual learner and communicator. I love communicating with diverse populations. As a former teacher and university instructor, I can succinctly communicate complex topics (with little notice) to a varied audience... YESSS! 

🎯🔮As for my future, my immediate goal is to utilize the skills developed in my MBA to pivot into industry and attain an analyst or product manager role. My goal is to bring my organizational skills, efficiency and experience in overseeing large-scale budgets, and creating high impact to these future roles.

🛩🍜In my free time you can find me exploring ethnic restaurants, travelling and glued to Audible.
